            <h3 class="essay"> Setting the Scene: Post-transactional Street Level Voids</h3>
            <p class="essay"> The year is 2042, and gone are the retail spaces that used to line our streets. The
                declining number of physical retail establishments is a trend in the urban environment that has been
                well on its way since over a century ago <a
                    href="https://doi-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/10.2148/benv.48.1.11">(Kickert, 2022)</a>. However,
                with the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, the shift was accelerated as the market was pushed to innovate new
                technologies that made online retail both a better experience for consumers and more cost efficient for
                businesses. This left a real visible impact on our urban fabric, many vacant lots were left in its wake.

            <p class="essay">
                As street-level social and economic realities shift much faster than the built stock, these spaces
                that used to be storefronts are forced to physically and functionally adapt to new uses. It did not take
                long for the city to discover that as our neighborhood experiences are so intrinsically tied to our
                relationship to these spaces – as they set the stage to Jane Jacobs’ sidewalk ballet, if you will –
                leaving them empty resulted in unhealthy communities and social decay <a
                    href="https://doi.org/10.2307/794509">(Jacob, 1962)</a>.
                A comparison between a 1911 storefront database of The Hague with that of 2017 demonstrates that about a
                fifth of storefronts have changed to a post-transactional use. Many of these new uses have spurred the
                creative economy, illustrating the resilient urban value of storefronts beyond merely hosting consumer
                transactions <a href="https://doi-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/10.2148/benv.48.1.11">(Kickert,

                It became a clear signal that there needs to be a new intervention that anchors us to our physical
                environment as society continues to transfer activities like work and school to virtual ones. <br>

            <h3 class="essay"> New Problem: Democratic Placemaking </h3>
            <p class="essay">

                While street-level brick-and-mortar stores continue to empty out, our cities were also making great
                strides in restructuring their economic systems, implementing socialist policies that supported the
                growing population of those whose work sectors have been taken over by machine automation. By way of a
                miracle, in the short span of the 20 years, the city found a way to decouple the urban form from its
                capitalist economy. This allowed the city to reclaim these voids, and reimagine them as more than just
                business spaces that respond to our material and economic, and transform them into community co-owned
                spaces that answers to social and cultural based needs.

                <br> But with this opportunity, came new issues. Without the invisible hand of the market determining
                the use of the spaces, the city required a new process of urban decision-making. As money and property
                are no longer the basis for civic participation in this post-transactional world, the city had a real
                chance to strive for democratic and equitable placemaking.

                    Business Improvement Districts (BID) are a variation of special district governance where city
                    governments devolve the power to manage local assessments to sub-municipal organizations of local
                    stakeholders, allowing them to hold decision-making power over how these funds are spent. BID is
                    driven by a narrative of economic liberalism (individual choice, civic engagement, localism, and
                    grassroots development), to portray itself as color blind, democratic, and equitable.

                    markets to attract higher income residents, businesses and developers. It is a tool for
                    gentrification and for property owners to silence the voices of renters, to displace residents in
                    favor of profit all while in the name of localism.

                Inspired by participatory design principles introduced in the 1970s by John F.C. Turner and
                exemplified in housing projects like Villa Verde Housing, city planners decided that, just as the final
                use of the voids of these homes are determined by the ones that live in the house, these street level
                public voids and their uses will be determined by local stakeholders especially since residents can
                detect the city’s requirements far quicker than administrators can.

                They created a web portal for democratic urban design decision-making that takes geospatial
                realities into consideration. The system forefronts public choice principles and localism, putting
                grassroots democracy at work. The portal leverages machine learning’s ability to process large amounts
                of data to facilitate democratic processes and inform the built environment, creating a process that
                keeps citizens/users within the loop, allowing them to be designers/developers of their own city,
                defining their own specifications and needs. This system, paired with the development in modular
                construction technologies over the years that allowed for quick and easy changes to the built
                environment for them to meet the requirements of different use cases, made it possible for the city to
                update these spaces quarterly to flexibly meet the city’s ever changing needs. From galleries to dance
                studios, music clubs to community gardens, the urban fabric became one that is ever changing.

                However, not all opinions on a space should be considered equal. For example, a person who lives
                directly above a space should have more regarding the use of that space than someone who lives a 30
                minute commute away from that particular space. The system recognizes the importance of forefronting
                localism and empowering local stakeholders as they are those that the spaces serve most and can best
                identify district-specific needs with most accurately.
                <br>Our Place takes this into consideration by having every user create an account tied to their current

                vacant spot, their response is weighted by a distance score. These distance scores are assigned based on
                an ordinal sorting of the participant’s relationship to the space from the participants’ perspective.
                That is to say for every user, Our Place calculates their distance between all the spaces in the city
                and ranks them from closest to furthest. Based on the order of ranking, the distance score a given user
                has for the space is assigned from 1 to 0.1. So if two users share the same closest space, they both
                have a distance score of 1 that weighs their responses to suggestions associated with the space,

                While ensuring people have equal access to spaces is a goal the program is working towards, the
